# Breast Cancer Prediction

**Status: In Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently under development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

# Overview

This repository demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict breast cancer likelihood based on features derived from medical imaging. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for model development and evaluation, as well as a Flask web application that serves the model through a user-friendly interface. The Flask app is containerized using Docker, enabling easy deployment.

# Features

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Includes data preprocessing (cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models), modeling (Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest models), evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve), and prediction (predicting the likelihood of breast cancer).
- **Flask Web Application**: A web interface for breast cancer prediction, allowing users to interact with the model.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Both the Jupyter Notebook and the web application are containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent setup and easy deployment across different environments.


# Installation and Usage

To get started, clone the repository and choose how you want to run the Jupyter Notebook and Flask web applicationâ€”either by installing the necessary dependencies locally or by using Docker.

## Option 1: Using Play with Docker
If you prefer an easy, browser-based solution, you can use [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).
You can run both the Jupyter Notebook and Flask web application using [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/), either by building the images locally or by pulling them from Docker Hub.

1. Start a New Session on [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) and add an instance.
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ilagri/Breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd Breast-cancer-prediction
```
3. Build and run the Docker containers as described below.

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

- **Option 1: Build Locally**

```bash
docker build -t breast-cancer-prediction .
docker run -p 8888:8888 breast-cancer-prediction
```

- **Option 2: Pull from Docker Hub**

```bash
docker pull ilagri/breast-cancer-prediction:latest
docker run -p 8888:8888 ilagri/breast-cancer-prediction:latest
```

Access the notebook at http://localhost:8888.

## Running the Flask Web Application

- **Option 1: Build Locally**

```bash
cd flask_app
docker build -t flask-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
```
- **Option 2: Pull from Docker Hub**

```bash
docker pull ilagri/flask-app:latest
docker run -p 5000:5000 ilagri/flask-app:latest
```
Access the Web Application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to interact with the web app.

   
### Install Dependencies

This project relies on Python and several libraries. You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have pip installed, you can follow the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install it.
