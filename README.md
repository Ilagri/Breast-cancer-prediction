# Breast Cancer Prediction

**Status: In Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently under development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

# Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict breast cancer likelihood based on features from medical imaging. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for model development and a Flask web application for serving the model as an API or web interface.

# Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ilagri/Breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd Breast-cancer-prediction
```

### Install Dependencies

This project relies on Python and several libraries. You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have pip installed, you can follow the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install it.

# Usage
After installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the code, run experiments, and view the results.

### Running Jupyter Notebook

To start the Jupyter Notebook server, run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb
```
This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open a new tab in your web browser where you can interact with the notebook.

# Docker

## Jupyter Notebook
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

- **Option 1: Build Locally**

```bash
docker build -t breast-cancer-prediction .
docker run -p 8888:8888 breast-cancer-prediction
```

- **Option 2: Pull from Docker Hub**

```bash
docker pull ilagri/breast-cancer-prediction:latest
docker run -p 8888:8888 ilagri/breast-cancer-prediction:latest
```

Access the notebook at http://localhost:8888.

## Flask Web Application
Run the Flask app:

- **Option 1: Build Locally**

```bash
cd flask_app
docker build -t flask-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
```

- **Option 2: Pull from Docker Hub**

```bash
docker pull ilagri/flask-app:latest
docker run -p 5000:5000 ilagri/flask-app:latest
```

Access the web app at http://localhost:5000.

## Using Play with Docker
1. Start a New Session on [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) and add an instance.
2. Clone the Repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ilagri/Breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd Breast-cancer-prediction
```
3. Build / Pull and Run the Docker container as described above.
