# Breast Cancer Prediction

**Status: In Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently under development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

# Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on a dataset of features extracted from medical imaging. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook that covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions. The environment is fully Dockerized for ease of replication and deployment.

# Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models.
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest models.
- **Evaluation**:
  - ***Metrics***: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - ***Confusion Matrix***: Visual representation of the performance of the classification model.
  - ***ROC Curve***: Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
- **Prediction**: Predicting the likelihood of breast cancer.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Consistent setup using Docker.
